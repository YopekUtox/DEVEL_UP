# DEVEL_UP
A simple script to earn exp for messages on servers 👾🦾
- Works on MEE6, ProBot bots and probably many others !

### How it works ? ⚙️
- The script sends a message (from your account) to the specified channel on the server and suddenly removes it. For this, it does not create spam and earns exp for the user. This was tested on the example of ProBot.

### Required for operation 🦿
- **Python 3.7** - at 95% I'm sure it will work on other versions 👌
- **Libary** - os, sys, json, discord. If you need download discord.py try:
 
    **#1.** Download this from this side https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/

    **#2.** Type in terminal/console " pip install discord.py "

    **#3.** In script just select option 4 - install libary, automatic version 
- **Config.json** - just keep it in the same directory with script.py   

🤚🤚🤚 Remember 🤚🤚🤚

**Using the script may result in a ban on the server where you are trying not to honestly get exp or even blocking your discord account**

⚡**Use at your own risk**⚡
